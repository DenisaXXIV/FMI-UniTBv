  <p>Procedural programming uses a list of instructions to tell the computer what to do step by step. Procedural programming relies on procedures, also known as routines. A procedure contains a series of computational steps to be carried out. Procedural programming is also referred to as imperative or structured programming.</p>
  <p>Procedural programming is intuitive in the sense that it is very similar to how you would expect a program to work. If you want a computer to do something, you should provide step-by-step instructions on how to do it. Many of the early programming languages are all procedural. Examples of procedural languages include Fortran, COBOL and C, which have been around since the 1960s and 70s.</p>
  <p>A common technique in procedural programming is to repeat a series of steps using iteration. This means you write a series of steps and then tell the program to repeat these steps a certain number of times. This makes it possible to automate repetitive tasks. </p> 


## Java

### Homework 1 : Recursion

  * Ex.6 
    - (a) Add an item to the end of a list

    - (b) Concatenate two lists
   
## Prolog
Prolog is a logic programming language associated with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics.

### Homework 2 : Lists in Prolog

  * Ex.1 - Write a predicate that calculates the c.m.m.d.c. between the minimum and maximum elements of a list.
  * Ex.3 - Write a predicate that deletes the first occurrence of the minimum from a list.
  * Ex.8 - Write a predicate that transforms a list into one of the form: [(element, element_occurrences)].
  
### Homework 3 : Lists in Prolog

## Lisp
Lisp is a family of programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix notation. Originally specified in 1958, Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language still in common use.
