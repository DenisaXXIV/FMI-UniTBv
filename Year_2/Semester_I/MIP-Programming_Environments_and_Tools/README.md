## Exam subject: 

A container consists of elements and has a fixed (unchangeable) size. A client searches for an item in the container, if it finds it, it returns it with its details (which are also kept in the container), if it does not find it, puts it in the container along with its details. If the container is full, it will remove the item with the fewest accesses from the container, and if there are several such items, the one that has been accessed the most is the last one.

*maximum container size: 7
